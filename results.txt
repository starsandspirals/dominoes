COM2001 Assignment 3
Experimental Results

These are my test results, where I test each of my players against each other
and also against the randomPlayer and hsdPlayer, to show that adding more
tactics makes the player better by increasing its knowledge of dominoes.

Some of my tactics made the player worse and so I haven't used them; tests of
these tactics are included below to show that the results did not improve using
these tactics.

---

easyPlayer

easyPlayer's only tactic is the hsdTactic which plays the highest scoring
domino, so it beats the randomPlayer quite significantly but is mostly even
against the hsdPlayer.

*Main> domsMatch easyPlayer randomPlayer 1000 345
(960,40)

*Main> domsMatch easyPlayer randomPlayer 1000 678
(959,41)

*Main> domsMatch easyPlayer hsdPlayer 1000 345
(491,509)

*Main> domsMatch easyPlayer hsdPlayer 1000 678
(558,442)

---

mediumPlayer

mediumPlayer has an added tactic called score61Tactic, which means that it
tries to reach 61 and win the game if possible, and otherwise if it has a high
score it tries to get to 59. This improves its results relative to the
easyPlayer.

*Main> domsMatch mediumPlayer randomPlayer 1000 345
(985,15)

*Main> domsMatch mediumPlayer randomPlayer 1000 678
(988,12)

*Main> domsMatch mediumPlayer easyPlayer 1000 345
(588,412)

*Main> domsMatch mediumPlayer easyPlayer 1000 678
(639,361)

hardPlayer

hardPlayer has two additional tactics; firstDropTactic, which means that it 
tries to play the (5,4) domino on an empty board if possible, and
opponentNearTactic, which tries to block the opponent from getting to 61.
These, again, improve performance relative to the mediumPlayer.

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer randomPlayer 1000 345
(987,13)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer randomPlayer 1000 678
(982,18)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer easyPlayer 1000 345
(599,401)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer easyPlayer 1000 678
(638,362)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 345
(502,498)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 678
(546,454)

---

hardPlayer with dangerousTactic

dangerousTactic tries to avoid playing valuable dominoes if they cannot
be knocked off. This tactic reduces the performance of the player.

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 345
(495,505)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 678
(533,467)

---

hardPlayer with majorityTactic

majorityTactic tries to play dominoes containing a particular pip value when
the hand contains the majority of that pip value. This tactic reduces the
performance of the player.

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 345
(491,509)

*Main> domsMatch hardPlayer mediumPlayer 1000 678
(522,478)

---

cheatingPlayer

cheatingPlayer is an extra player I wrote for fun, that probably shouldn't
be marked. It plays whatever imaginary domino would score exactly 61 points
in one move, ignoring the contents of its hand and the rules of dominoes,
allowing it to win every time. :)

*Main> domsMatch cheatingPlayer hardPlayer 1000 345
(1000,0)

*Main> domsMatch cheatingPlayer hardPlayer 1000 678
(1000,0)
